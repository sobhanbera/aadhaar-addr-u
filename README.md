### Overview
In the last 10 years, Aadhaar has enabled 130+ cr residents of India, spread from Turtuk in the north to Indira Point in the south, Guhar Moti in the west to Kibithu in the east with digital identity. It has supported inclusiveness by enabling residents to interface with various Digital India initiatives.

To facilitate enrolment to the Aadhaar platform and for the subsequent update of Aadhaar during life events, UIDAI has established a large number of enrolment centers across the country. Also, it has established a self-service online platform to interface and undertake update of demographics data. Even with the abundance of touch points, UIDAI believes that there is a scope to improve the experience around the online address update process through the adaptation of technology

The Aadhaar team is calling for innovative ideas and solutions, backed up by demonstrable code from young minds to enhance the address update experience of a resident.
